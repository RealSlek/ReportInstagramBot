        Reasons why victim's account is not getting banned

        [ 1️⃣ ] The fact is that the account could be deleted by Instagram because of three or four 
        reports from various accounts due to the reason given for reporting the account. 
        All Instagram accounts reported in violation of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Use 
        will be deleted. Only accounts that meet one or both guidelines will be removed.

        [ 2️⃣ ] You don't have good proxies. You need to buy paid proxy or crack some good qualities.
        To buy proxies go to my insta and ask proxy.
